# rp_adapter

This is the layout of the 4th iteration of this board.  Currently the design in this directory is the 
transceiver consisting of a connector to the Red Pitaya, the OpenHPSDR TAPR LPU, the OpenHPSDR TAPR T/R board, 
a 1W PA taken from the OpenHPSDR Penelope board, and a simple 18db ish LNA.  

The connecitivy is built to interface to an external amplifier, the Hermes RX Filter from EB104.ru and
the 300W LPF from EB104.ru. You need to get the amp keying from the EB104.ru LPF board. 

Enjoy
