The reasoning here is simple. Most of this design is a compendeum of existng TAPR boards put into one layout.

The only orignal pieces are the filter control, connectivity to the Red Pitaya and the LNA.  

The power system is a copy of the TAPR LPU. The 1W PA is extracted from the Penelope, and the T/R design is 
from the TAPR T/R board.
